# Vercel Deployment Guide for Routine Tracker App

This guide focuses specifically on deploying your Routine Tracker App to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account with your project repository
- Vercel account (sign up at https://vercel.com if you don't have one)
- Your Routine Tracker App code ready and pushed to a repository

## Step 1: Prepare Your Project

Ensure your project has:

1. A functioning build process (in package.json)
2. Proper environment variables configured (if needed)
3. All dependencies correctly listed in package.json

## Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

### Option A: Using the Vercel Web Interface

1. Log in to your Vercel account at https://vercel.com
2. Click "New Project" on your dashboard
3. Import your project repository from GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
4. Configure the project:
   - **Framework Preset**: Select "Create React App" (or your specific framework)
   - **Build Command**: Verify it's set to `npm run build` or `yarn build`
   - **Output Directory**: Verify it's set to `build`
   - **Environment Variables**: Add any required environment variables
5. Click "Deploy"

### Option B: Using Vercel CLI

1. Install the Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   # or
   yarn global add vercel
   ```

2. Log in to Vercel via the CLI:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. Navigate to your project directory and deploy:
   ```bash
   cd /home/backspace/App
   vercel
   ```

4. Follow the CLI prompts:
   - Link to an existing project or create a new one
   - Confirm settings like build command and output directory
   - Set up any environment variables

## Step 3: Configure Domain (Optional)

1. From your Vercel project dashboard, go to "Settings" > "Domains"
2. Add your custom domain
3. Follow Vercel's instructions to configure DNS settings

## Step 4: Set Up Continuous Deployment

After the initial deployment, Vercel will automatically deploy updates whenever you push changes to your repository.

To configure branch deployments:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to the "Git" section
3. Configure production and preview branch settings as needed

## Step 5: Monitor Your Deployment

1. Check deployment logs in your Vercel dashboard
2. Test your deployed application thoroughly
3. Set up monitoring with Vercel Analytics or external tools

## Troubleshooting

- **Build Failures**: Check build logs for errors and make sure your build configuration is correct
- **API Routes Not Working**: Ensure your API routes are compatible with Vercel serverless functions
- **Environment Variables**: Double-check your environment variables are properly set in Vercel project settings
